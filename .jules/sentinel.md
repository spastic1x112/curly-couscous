## 2025-05-14 - MT19937 State Reconstruction Validation
**Vulnerability:** Memory-exhaustion DoS and potential OverflowError in random.setstate().
**Learning:** Python's random.setstate() for MT19937 accepts integers up to the size of C's unsigned long (64-bit on many systems), but the algorithm expects 32-bit values. Providing values outside this range can lead to incorrect behavior or OverflowError. Additionally, reading unlimited input from files to collect state values can lead to DoS.
**Prevention:** Strictly validate that input values for MT19937 are 32-bit unsigned integers (0 to 2^32-1) and limit the number of values read from external files to the required amount (624 for MT19937).
